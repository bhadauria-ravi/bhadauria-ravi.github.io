## Multiscale methods for fluid transport in nanochannels

As a doctoral student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I have worked on the development of high fidelity multiscale methods to understand fluid flow past solid interfaces. Because of the dominant surface effects at the nanoscale, the classical field based continuum models break down. Particle-based methods offer accurate insights into the flow physics but are computationally expensive. In addition, the ratio of pertinent to total information (particle trajectories) from these simulations is very small. My research entailed bridging these two descriptions of the flow physics at disparate scales to a unified, field based quasi-continuum framework that can provide atomic level accuracy with continuum level efficiency. This methodology of multiscale dynamical “coarse-grained” (CG) framework was successively refined to incorporate multi-physics in order to make it viable for a variety of flow situations, such as Couette flow and gravity-driven flows of single- and multi-component fluids as well as electro-hydrodynamics. Our adsorption based understanding of the flow physics elucidated that the slip length does not change with the pore width as previously conjectured. The resultant suite of multiscale models significantly reduced the computational burden from tens of thousands of hours to seconds, without trading off the accuracy of the intermediate transport properties.

## Thermal noise effects in nanoparticle dynamics and transport

Another aspect of my research at the University of Illinois has been the development of a stochastic framework capable of describing the dynamics of fullerene family based nanoparticles in the solvent. Making use of generalized Langevin equation (GLE) with memory effects, we implicitly accounted for the short and intermediate time features of solvent dissipative and thermal effects on nanoparticle dynamics. We demonstrated that the variance of the solvent-thermal force, and not its relaxation time determines the “memory” or “memoryless” behavior of nanoparticle motion.
