### ML Engineering @ Etsy

## [Blog](blog/table_of_contents.md)

I am a Senior ML Engineer at Etsy Inc., where I work on orchestration systems for online model inference.

Before Etsy, I worked at Centene Corporation where I was  involved in creating and deploying scalable Machine Learning solutions to mitigate Fraud, Waste, and Abuse in the medical claims area. I am equally competent using techniques from both shallow and deep learning, and productionalizing boutique data science models within the in house ML infrastructure.

Prior to Centene, at Intel Corporation, I was a Senior Imagining Scientist / Software Engineer and was involved in Intel’s creating digital twin of lithography process that involved working in cross functional domain such as image processing, and developing chemical and optical computational models.

As a doctoral student in the department of Mechanical Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I worked on [computational transport models](phdwork/research.md) in nanopores and nanochannels that bridged the gap between particle based simulations with continuum formulations.
